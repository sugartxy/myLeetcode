/**
Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

Example:

Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
*/
/**
Adding 1 to n - 1 elements is the same as subtracting 1 from one element
*/
public class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        int count=0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int min=nums[0];
        for(int i=1;i<nums.length;i++){
            count+=nums[i]-min;
        }
        return count;
    }
